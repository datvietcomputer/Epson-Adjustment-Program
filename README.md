Discover the Epson Adjustment Program, the official service tool for resetting “Service Required” errors, waste ink pad counters, printhead alignment, and EEPROM management for Epson printers.
Epson Adjustment Program – The Ultimate Reset and Maintenance Tool for Epson Printers
1. Overview

The Epson Adjustment Program, also known as the Epson Service Program or Epson Reset Utility, is an official maintenance software developed by Epson. It allows users and service engineers to reset, calibrate, and maintain Epson inkjet printers of various models — from home printers to professional photo and large-format printers.

When an Epson printer displays a “Service Required” message or stops printing due to “Waste Ink Pad Counter Overflow”, the Adjustment Program becomes the essential tool to bring it back to normal operation.

This software helps not only to clear internal error counters but also to perform printhead alignment, clean ink systems, manage EEPROM data, and recalibrate sensors, ensuring consistent, high-quality performance and long printer lifespan.

2. What Is the Epson Adjustment Program?

The Epson Adjustment Program is a specialized service software that communicates directly with the printer’s internal system. It provides access to service-level operations that regular users cannot perform through the standard Epson driver or control panel.

This program is used by:

Epson authorized service centers,

Printer repair technicians,

Advanced users or printing professionals who need full control over maintenance and calibration processes.

With the Adjustment Program, users can:

Reset waste ink counters,

Restore factory settings,

Initialize EEPROM,

Perform nozzle checks, head cleaning, and ink charge,

Adjust head alignment and paper feed,

And diagnose errors that prevent normal operation.

3. Why Epson Printers Need the Adjustment Program

All Epson inkjet printers are equipped with a waste ink pad system — a sponge that collects excess ink during cleaning cycles. When the printer estimates that the pad is full, it stops printing and shows the message “Service Required” to prevent ink overflow.

However, in most cases, the physical pad is not yet full — it’s only a safety limit set by the printer’s firmware. The Epson Adjustment Program allows users to reset this internal counter, restoring the printer’s functionality instantly.

Besides resetting waste ink counters, the software is also essential for:

Maintaining print quality through regular head cleaning,

Calibrating color accuracy and alignment,

Fixing sensor misreads and mechanical synchronization issues,

And restoring the printer after part replacement or firmware update.

4. Key Features of the Epson Adjustment Program

The program provides a full set of maintenance and diagnostic functions. Here are its main capabilities:

4.1. Waste Ink Pad Counter Reset

Resets the “Service Required” or “Ink Pad Full” error message.

Allows the printer to operate normally again without replacing the physical ink pad.

Saves maintenance time and costs for both technicians and end-users.

4.2. EEPROM Initialization and Backup

Reads, backs up, or restores the printer’s internal EEPROM data.

Resets all settings to factory default values.

Useful after replacing the mainboard or making major service adjustments.

4.3. Printhead Cleaning and Ink Charge

Performs Power Cleaning and Initial Ink Charge to clear clogged nozzles.

Ensures stable ink flow and prevents banding or missing lines during printing.

Maintains color consistency and overall print quality.

4.4. Printhead Alignment (Head Adjustment)

Calibrates the printhead’s horizontal and vertical alignment.

Eliminates banding, misregistration, and blurred edges.

Supports both Auto Adjustment and Manual Adjustment modes.

4.5. Sensor and Encoder Calibration

Adjusts the paper feed, carriage, and PF encoder sensors.

Fixes feeding errors, misalignment, or irregular movement during printing.

Ensures precise positioning for accurate and professional output.

4.6. Printer Information and Status Check

Displays printer model, firmware version, ink levels, and usage counters.

Records print statistics and error logs for technical analysis.

Ideal for preventive maintenance and service documentation.

5. Supported Epson Printer Models

The Epson Adjustment Program supports a wide range of printers, including:
